    <p>This is a simple webpage with no visualization component whatsoever. All it has is some paragraphs of meaningless text.</p>
    <p>See, this is another one. Nothing worth reading in here at all, this is merely filler. What we will be doing is opening the console up and playing with D3 directly, so we can see how it can be used to manipulate the elements on the page. It is merely a prelude.</p>
    <p>Finally there is this paragraph, which surprisingly, also has some text</p>
